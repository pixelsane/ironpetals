### Martial Arts
[[開掌流 (Kaishō-ryū)]]

### Blood Type: AB

### Reason For Fighting
Being the last senior disciple of 開掌流 (Kaishō-ryū), she was given the sole responsibility of becoming a true master (Shin Shoshi).
And unlike other schools, Kaisho-ryu mastery can only be achieved by defeating a thousand insurmountable foes.
This becomes her lifelong journey before she can pass down the art to the next generation.
