A martial arts tradition built on **fluid motion, deceptive grace, and explosive force**. At first glance, its practitioners seem gentle — their movements sweeping, circular, almost dance-like. But behind the elegance lies a brutal efficiency.

Kaishō-ryū centers around **open palm strikes**, leveraging body mechanics, torque, and precision to deliver devastating impacts. Every motion flows from the hips and core, building power like a wave before it crashes into the opponent — often aimed at vulnerable spots: the **temples, chin, jaw, or back of the head**.

What defines Open Palm is its **tactical philosophy**:

> “Destabilize the roots. Rattle the mind.”

Students train to **unbalance** their foes with short, sharp footwork and leverage — pushing or redirecting their weight just enough to leave them exposed. Then, in a flash, they deliver a **bone-rattling palm strike**, often strong enough to stagger even the most hardened sumo.

Despite lacking the overt brutality of fists or elbows, Kaishō-ryū’s open hand strikes are **calculated to concuss, disorient, incapacitate, or even kill**. Its elegance is a veil — the softness a setup for shock.

### Core Principles:

- **Yūwa (柔和)** – Softness is a lure
- **Kaiten (回転)** – Rotation builds power
- **Datsuza (脱座)** – Dislodge the stance    
- **Hōdan (砲弾)** – Strikes like a cannon shell

---

### Training Methods:

- **Head Targeting Drills** – Striking sandbags and moving dummies at temple/jawline angles
- **Balance Disruption Sparring** – Light-contact matches focusing only on throws and unbalancing
- **Power Palming** – Conditioned open palm training vs tree trunks or padded walls
- **Heavy Stance Conditioning** – Students are trained to **out-grip** and **out-root** traditional sumo wrestlers

### Ranking System
Kaishō-ryū disavows traditional belt hierarchy. They believe it is ridiculous.
Graduation comes from combat experience.

_“To open the palm is to open the path to real strength.”_  
Kaishō-ryū rejects the vanity of colored belts and ceremonial rankings. In their philosophy, **skill is proven through battle, not appearance.**

The **only currency of advancement** is **experience in real, difficult combat**. Students must overcome increasingly brutal trials — not in staged sparring, but in unrelenting, often improvised encounters against real threats or equally trained opponents.

### No Belts. Only Titles.

Each rank is tied to a title, earned through exacting and quantified combat trials. These titles are not awarded lightly — and they are never self-declared. Witnessed victories or teacher-sanctioned trials are required for legitimacy.

### **Ranking Titles & Requirements:**

#### 1. **Palmling (掌児 - Shōji)**
_"The child of the palm."_
- Newcomer. Not officially ranked.
- Learns breathing, stance, and how not to die.
- Must complete a **100-day endurance regimen** to be permitted to train under an instructor.
#### 2. **Apprentice (掌徒 - Shōto)**
_"One who follows the palm."_
- Must defeat **100 opponents of superior size or strength** in practice bouts, street fights, or warzones.
- Only **fights observed by a senior** count.
- Training focuses on unbalancing techniques and striking flow.
#### 3. **Senior Apprentice (掌修 - Shōshū)**
_"One who refines the palm."_
- Earned by defeating **500 opponents of equal skill** in unarmed combat — often other martial artists.
- Combat must be full contact and unchoreographed.
- At this level, one begins to instruct Palmlings under supervision.
#### 4. **Young Master (掌師 - Shōshi)**
_"Palm Master in Bloom."_
- The most feared trial: defeat **1,000 foes who vastly outmatch you**.
- These need not be consecutive but must be **insurmountable by conventional logic** — larger, armed, stronger, multiple enemies at once.
- A log is kept of every trial. Most never reach this tier.
- The few who do are capable of breaking ribs and staggering beasts with a single strike.   
#### 5. **True Master (真掌師 - Shin Shōshi)**
_"True Master of the Palm."_
- Not granted by numbers. Only by defeating the strongest masters will this title be granted.
- It is said that at it's peak only **five equally matched living individuals** hold this title at a time. However due to great unpopularity, the only living master passed away and left it to an apprentice who has yet to reach Shoshi. [[Nova Oda]].
