A prestigious private academy hidden in the Shoto outskirts, Shinseikan High is both a high school and an elite martial academy. It’s known across Japan (and in whispers abroad) as the crucible where future champions, assassins, bodyguards, underground fighters, and even spiritual warriors are forged. Enrollment is limited, and reputation within the school is everything.

Academic graduates of good standing will be rewarded a boon to the student and also their dojos. If they do not have a dojo, the council will pick an adjacent entity.

### Ruling
While rules are often followed, exceptions are commonly made through challenges to the rule setters. The rule setter, however has the right to reject the challenges.
